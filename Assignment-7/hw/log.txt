Laboratory:


I followed the instructions on Piazza and the lab spec handout to do this lab.
My partner for the lab was Prabhjot (UID: 304956577).

I connected my beaglebone to my computer using the USB. Once, that was done
I accessed BEAGLEBONE as an external storage device. I opened the START.htm
file and installed both the packages for mac. Once, that was done, I did:

     $sudo ssh root@192.168.7.2

Host name: 192.168.7.2
Port: 22
Username: root
Password: <blank>

We used my partner's hotspot for the lab and conncted both the beaglebones to the wifi. 
   $ sudo connmanctl
   connmanctl> enable wifi
   connmanctl> scan wifi
   connmanctl> services

This displays all the nearby WiFi access points. 
I used "connect" command to connnect to the same hotspot.

Retrieve the public IP address for the BeagleBones using:
   $ ifconfig

Installed the xauth, xterm, and others for client and server was done using:
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install openssh-server
    $ sudo apt-get install openssh-client
    $ sudo apt-get install xauth
    $ sudo apt-get install firefox-esr-l10n-en-gb


Entered the following command on the client and server and answered
the related prompts to generate keys. 

   $ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/kanishashah/.ssh/id_rsa): 
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /Users/kanishashah/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /Users/kanishashah/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:1QuBZFlumxDljVHk1jsItiRzp6z4YwE9Tcy3yARvN/c kanishashah@Kanishas-MBP
The key's randomart image is:

Create client's account on server and password:
       $ sudo useradd –d /home/ks -m ks
       $ sudo passwd ks
       	 <pushpin>


Create .ssh directories, and change permission for client
      $ cd
      $ cd /home/ks
      $ sudo mkdir .ssh
      $ sudo chown –R ks .ssh
      $ sudo chmod 700 .ssh


Do the following on the client to copy the public key on server:
      $ ssh-copy-id -i ks@192.168.1.38
      
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/Users/kanishashah/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"

default username:password is [debian:temppwd]

ks@192.168.1.38's password: 

Number of key(s) added:        1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'ks@192.168.1.38'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.


    Add the private key to ssh-agent on server from client:
    $ ssh-add
    
Identity added: /Users/kanishashah/.ssh/id_rsa (/Users/kanishashah/.ssh/id_rsa)

ssh to server from client to the created user
    ssh ks@192.168.1.38

Following commands are used to make directories and see them:
	  $ mkdir ks
	  $ mkdir temp
	  $ ls
	  ks  temp


Now ssh to the server from client as root 
    $ ssh -X root@192.168.1.38

Following commands are used to make directories and see them:
	  root@beaglebone:~# mkdir DIIR
	  root@beaglebone:~# ls
	  DIIR


Set password for the root user of the server:
   $ sudo passwd root
     <cow>


Following commands launched GUI based programs on server side, but were
being displayed as windows on client side:
    $ xterm
    $ gedit
    $ firefox


The roles can be reversed and same steps can be followed to complete the lab.
