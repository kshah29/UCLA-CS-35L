Laboratory:

1. I type this command in my terminal to upload the tar file
in my computer to my working directory on seas.ucla server.
scp ~/Downloads/coreutils-7.6.tar kanisha@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu:~/CS35L


2. After that I moved my tar file to a new directory lab3 using
mv coreutils-7.6.tar lab3

Then, I installed coreutils-7.6 by following steps:
./configure
make
echo $? #printed "0" - No errors, it executed successfully
make install
echo $? # prited "2" - did not execute successfully 

The error said that ls does not have the permission to
exceute '/usr/local/bin/./install'.
This means that PATH needs to be added for configure command.
We type the following commands:

cd coreutils-7.6
./configure --prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/kanisha/CS35L/lab3/coreutils-7.6
make
echo $? #printed "0" -> No errors
make install
echo $?	#printed "0" ->	No errors


3. Find the current locale type:
locale
It is of the type: "en_US.UTF-8"
So, we do not need to change it.

We go inside the bin directory of the unzipped folder
and run ls of that directory using:
cd bin
./ls -l

Here is what we get:
-rwxr-xr-x 1 kanisha csugrad 131496 2018-01-28 11:38 [
-rwxr-xr-x 1 kanisha csugrad 124416 2018-01-28 11:38 base64


4. I first looked at man page of patch to see how to apply:
man patch

To apply the patch I went to the src directory of unzipped folder
and made a new patchfile containing the diff output
cd ../src #this will bring to the src directory
emacs patchfile #Now copy-paste output, save and close

Here is the patch:

Now that the patch file is ready, we use following commands:
patch < patchfile

It displays following:
patching file ls.c
Hunk #1 succeeded at 2013 (offset -1 lines).
Hunk #2 succeeded at 2028 (offset -1 lines).

echo $? #printed "0" -> No errors


5. We now run make comand
We first go to the unzipped tar folder
cd .. #we are in ~/CS35L/lab3/coreutils-7.6
make
echo $? #printed "0" -> No errors

It executed lot lesser files than previous one.
Inside src, it only executed
ls.o
dir
vdir
ls
Previously, it executed all the files. 
This time it only executed the modified files.


6. We go to the src directory and make a new file
with old modification date
touch -m -t 199805291000 oldfile
Now we will test the patched ls command inside the src directory:
./ls -l *file
-rw-r--r-- 1 kanisha csugrad 117947 Jan 28 11:36 Makefile
-rw-r--r-- 1 kanisha csugrad      0 May 29  1998 oldfile
-rw-r--r-- 1 kanisha csugrad   1043 Jan 28 14:04 patchfile

This is the old version of ls:
~/CS35L/lab3/coreutils-7.6/bin/ls -l *file
-rw-r--r-- 1 kanisha csugrad 117947 2018-01-28 11:36 Makefile
-rw-r--r-- 1 kanisha csugrad      0 1998-05-29 10:00 oldfile
-rw-r--r-- 1 kanisha csugrad   1043 2018-01-28 14:04 patchfile

Because we used the make command and not make install,
we only made changes to the ls file of src.
Hence, we need to test the new ls command in the src file.
