Performance was compared for different versions of sfrob
using time when different file sizes were inputted 

* STDIN was a file of 25541 bytes and had 150 lines

a) sfrobu.c without option f (unbuffered version)
time -p ./sfrobu < as4 > out_sfrobu
real 0.05
user 0.00
sys 0.03

b) sfrobu.c with option f (unbuffered version)
time -p ./sfrobu -f < as4 > out_sfrobu
real 0.05
user 0.01
sys 0.04

c) shell script sfrobs without option f
time -p ./sfrobs < as4 > out_sfrobs
real 0.01
user 0.00
sys 0.00

d) shell script sfrobs with option f
time -p ./sfrobs -f < as4 > out_sfrobs
real 0.00
user 0.00
sys 0.00

e) sfrob.c - no option (buffered version)
time -p ./sfrob < as4 > out_sfrob
real 0.00
user 0.00
sys 0.00


* STDIN was a file of 75522 bytes and had 1019 lines

a)  sfrobu.c without option f (unbuffered version)
time -p ./sfrobu < as5 > out_sfrobu
real 0.13
user 0.03
sys 0.10

b) sfrobu.c with option f (unbuffered version)
time -p ./sfrobu -f < as5 > out_sfrobu
real 0.15
user 0.02
sys 0.12

c) shell script sfrobs without option f
time -p ./sfrobs < as5 > out_sfrobs
real 0.02
user 0.00
sys 0.02

d) shell script sfrobs with option f
time -p ./sfrobs -f < as5 > out_sfrobs
real 0.01
user 0.00
sys 0.00

e) sfrob.c - no option (buffered version)
time -p ./sfrob < as5 > out_sfrob
real 0.01
user 0.00
sys 0.00


* STDIN was a file of 1113623  bytes and had 10120 lines

a)  sfrobu.c without option f (unbuffered version)
time -p ./sfrobu < as7 > out_sfrobu
real 2.00
user 0.38
sys 1.61

b) sfrobu.c with option f (unbuffered version)
time -p ./sfrobu -f < as7 > out_sfrobu
real 2.37
user 0.41
sys 1.94

c) shell script sfrobs without option f
time -p ./sfrobs < as7 > out_sfrobs
real 0.13
user 0.08
sys 0.06

d) shell script sfrobs with option f
time -p ./sfrobs -f < as7 > out_sfrobs
real 0.22
user 0.13
sys 0.10

e) sfrob.c - no option (buffered version)
time -p ./sfrob < as7 > out_sfrob
real 0.13
user 0.11
sys 0.00


As we can see, the unbuffered version takes 18 times more time
to run compared to shell script and sfrob.c
sfrob.c is slightly faster than shell script sfrobs.
Overall, sfrob.c and sfrobs performs better than sfrobu.
