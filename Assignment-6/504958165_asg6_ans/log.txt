To make a file contaning 10,000,000 random single-precision floating point numbers
each on a seperate line, we use the following command:
od -t f4 /dev/urandom | cut -c 10- | sed "s/ \n*  */\n/g" | sed "s/  */\n/g" | sed '/^$/d' | head -n 10000000 > file

od -t f4 shows every character as floating point of 4 bytes (single precision), whose input is /dev/urandom
cut -c 10- cuts first 10 chracters of each line, it will delete the numbers added by od
sed "s/ \n*  */\n/g" replaces combination of SP\n*SPSP* with \n, this will leave single spaces
sed "s/  */\n/g" replaces 1 or more space with \n (newline)
sed '/^$/d' deletes extra newlines
head -n 10000000 gives first 10000000 lines 
The final output is stored in file

Timing sort when sorted numerically and using multithreads (1, 2, 4, and 8)

1 thread: 
time -p sort -g --parallel=1 file > time_sort
real 123.20
user 118.08
sys 0.41

2 threads:
real 62.43
user 116.26
sys 0.63

4 threads:
real 37.08
user 117.04
sys 1.42

8 threads:
time -p sort -g --parallel=8 file > time_sort
real 33.45
user 145.12
sys 3.50
